Implement regular expression matching with the following special
 characters:

. (period) which matches any single character
* (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element
That is, implement a function that takes in a string and a valid 
regular expression and returns whether or not the string matches 
the regular expression.

For example, given the regular expression "ra." and the string "ray",
 your function should return true. The same regular expression on the 
 string "raymond" should return false.

Given the regular expression ".*at" and the string "chat", your
function should return true. The same regular expression on the string 
"chats" should return false.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
Example 3:

Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
Example 4:

Input: s = "aab", p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
Example 5:

Input: s = "mississippi", p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false
